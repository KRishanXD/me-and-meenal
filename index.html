  <header>Krishan ‚ù§Ô∏è Meenal ‚Äî Our Love Story</header>

  <section class="paragraph">
    <p>It's been 9 months with you, and honestly, I still can't believe how lucky I got. Life was pretty normal before you came in ‚Äî same boring days, same coding stress ‚Äî but since the day we started talking, everything feels different. You're the first person I actually feel safe with, like I can be myself around you without pretending.</p>
    <p>I don‚Äôt say it often, but I notice the little things ‚Äî how you smile when you're trying not to, how your voice softens when you're worried about me, how you get mad at the smallest things but cool down in 2 seconds (and then act like nothing happened üòÜ). Every single moment with you, even the silly fights, feels like a part of some movie I‚Äôd actually want to live in.</p>
    <p>You‚Äôve become my peace in the chaos. Even when I‚Äôm stressed with college, or feeling low, just one message from you changes everything. You make even the most random conversations feel special ‚Äî whether we're talking about food, your dreams, your insecurities, or just teasing each other till one of us gives up.</p>
    <p>There‚Äôs something about you‚Ä¶ maybe the way you care too much, or how you get excited about small things, or how you remember everything I say ‚Äî even the dumb stuff. You make me feel seen, heard, and loved in a way I‚Äôve never felt before. And I swear, I‚Äôve never laughed or smiled this much with anyone.</p>
    <p>I know I‚Äôm not perfect ‚Äî I mess up, forget things, act distant sometimes, and probably annoy you way too much. But even in those moments, you stay. And that means more to me than anything else.</p>
    <p>9 months in, and I still get excited seeing your name pop up on my phone. Still feel the same butterflies when I think about how we started. You‚Äôve become my favorite person without even trying.</p>
    <p>So this is for you ‚Äî for all the times you were there when no one else was, for all the care you gave without asking anything in return, for loving me when I couldn‚Äôt even love myself properly.</p>
    <p>I don't know what the future holds, but if I had one wish ‚Äî it would be to keep you with me through it all. Through every exam, every late-night coding session, every achievement, every breakdown. Just‚Ä¶ together.</p>
